CPUID is a library for accessing feature bits exposed by the CPUID
instruction on Intel's x86 processors.  It does not intend to expose
other information such as family, stepping, cache information, etc.

The interface is limited but functional: CPUID:HAS-FEATURE-P takes a
symbol denoting the desired feature name and returns T if the feature is
supported in the current implementation, NIL otherwise.  The supported
feature names can be found in feature-descriptors.lisp.  A description
of each feature name is located in the appropriate Intel or AMD manuals.
